	<h1>Opinion: Why American-Chinese food is real Chinese food</h1>

	<p id="CNN">(CNN)</p>Is American-Chinese food "real" Chinese food?</p>
	<p class="subheadline">That's a topic CNN staff and readers have debated -- with a lot of heat -- in the past.<BR>As American-Chinese restaurant Fortune Cookie closes shop in Shanghai this week, after successfully selling U.S.-style Chinese food to locals since opening in 2013 (despite a good run its American owners have said they want to return to the United States), we've decided to revisit journalist Clarissa Wei's previously published impassioned defense of orange chicken and all-American Chinese food.
	<p>Yes, I'm actually going to defend orange chicken.
	Fundamentally fried chicken with sauce -- the perfect late-night snack -- orange chicken is beloved by millions of people of all ethnic groups (including many Chinese) in the United States.
	As with most American-Chinese food, however, there's a stigma attached to orange chicken.
	<p>Chinese food snobs call the dish, as well as the restaurants that serve it, "fake" or "not authentic."
    How sad.
	Orange chicken, egg foo young and General Tso's chicken have fallen victim to a lot of hatemongers since their introduction to the U.S. culinary scene back in the 19th century.
	Those who unapologetically enjoy orange chicken -- and many other American-Chinese dishes -- and who actually know a little bit about the history of Chinese people outside of China are left to ponder a simple question: What is authenticity?</p>

	<h2>Cooked by Chinese for Chinese</h2>
	<p>There's nothing inauthentic about American-Chinese dishes.</p>
	<img src="http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/160114165722-sweet-sour-pork-exlarge-169.jpg" alt="American-Chinese food. Sweet? Or sour?">
	<p class="orange">The bulk of them were created by Chinese people for Chinese people.
	These Chinese people just happened to be living outside of the mother country.
	According to the "Oxford Encyclopedia of Food and Drink in America," during the 1840s Gold Rush in California, early Chinese immigrants (most were railroad builders) had no or extremely limited access to traditional Chinese ingredients.
	So they used what they could find in their new homes to create then-contemporary Chinese dishes, such as the now much-derided chop suey, one of the first Chinese dishes invented in the United States.</p>
	<p class="green">And who was eating this "fake" Chinese food?
	It sure wasn't white Americans, who at the time, with few exceptions, wanted almost nothing to do with the social and culinary customs of Chinese immigrants.
	Chop suey and many of the other American-Chinese basics that we know today weren't created to satisfy the supposedly inferior palates of white Americans.
	They were made to satisfy the cravings of "real" Chinese people.
	When railroad work was no longer available, many Chinese laborers resorted to opening restaurants.</P>
	<p class="lightblue">But it wasn't until after World War II in 1945 that mainstream Americans began eating and appreciating Chinese food in large numbers.
	By that time, the extensive American-Chinese menu was well established.
	Some 165 years on from the Gold Rush, not much has changed.
	Chinese restaurant owners and chefs are still primarily Chinese.
	Many come to the United States from China, and almost always for economic reasons.
	No matter how they end up in the States, however, food is the totem of their culture.</P>
