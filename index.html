<P>    
Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed
through some interesting places on the way:  </P>
    
    <ol>    
                 <li>Walla Walla, WA</li> <li>Magic City, ID</li> <li>Bountiful UT</li> <li> Last Chance, CO</li> <li> Truth or Consequences, NM</li> <li>Why, AZ
    </ol>

I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
<blockquote> "Passing cars, <BR>When you can't see,</BR> May get you, <BR>A glimpse,</BR> Of eternity."</blockquote>
I definitely won't be passing any cars.

My first day of the trip!  I can't believe I finally got
everything packed and ready to go.  Because I'm on a Segway,
I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: 
<ul><li>cellphone</li> <li>iPod</li> <li>digital camera</li> <li> and a protein bar</li> 
	<P>
Just the essentials.  As Lao Tzu would have said, "A journey of a thousand miles begins with one Segway."
